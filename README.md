## Overview
Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code (AoC) - an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to the 25th. This repository serves as my personal playground to explore new algorithms, refine my coding practices, and embrace the festive spirit of continuous learning and development.

## Goals for 2023
For the 2023 challenge, the primary focus areas will be:

1. **Algorithm Efficiency**: Prioritizing the optimization of time and space complexity for each solution to enhance performance and deepen my understanding of algorithm design.
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Implementing a more rigorous TDD approach using PyTest to ensure robustness and reliability of solutions. Each day's problem will be tackled with TDD principles, writing tests before the actual code.

## Restructuring for 2023
To align the repository structure with the goals for 2023, the following changes are proposed:

- **Algorithm Analysis**: Integrate a dedicated section for analyzing the time and space complexity of solutions, possibly with visualizations to represent efficiency gains.
- **Testing Framework**: Enhance the testing framework to support incremental test development, encouraging more frequent and comprehensive tests.
- **Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and README files for each day's challenge to better describe the problem, the approach taken, and the lessons learned.

Your suggestions and contributions to this learning journey are welcome!

## How to Use This Repository
Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific day in the Advent of Code challenge. Here's how you can navigate and utilize this repository:

- **Explore Solutions**: Browse through the directories to see the solutions for each day, along with time and space complexity analysis.
- **Run Tests**: Use PyTest to run the test suites for each day's problem to validate the solutions.
- **Learn and Share**: Feel free to use this as a resource for your own AoC challenges, and share your insights or improvements via issues or pull requests.

Happy coding, and may your holiday season be merry and bright with the joy of problem-solving!
